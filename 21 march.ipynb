    "1.Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both methods of encoding categorical variables as numerical values, but they \n",
    "differ in how they assign the numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding assigns integers to categories in order of their rank or order. For example, if you have a categorical \n",
    "variable of shirt sizes with categories \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\", ordinal encoding would assign the values of 1, 2,\n",
    "and 3 respectively, reflecting the relative ordering of the sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, assigns integers to categories in an arbitrary manner. For example, if you have a \n",
    "categorical variable of colors with categories \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\", label encoding might assign the values of 1, 2, \n",
    "and 3 respectively, with no inherent ordering implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between ordinal encoding and label encoding depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand. Ordinal \n",
    "encoding is appropriate when there is an inherent ordering or hierarchy among the categories, such as with shirt sizes or\n",
    "education levels. Label encoding may be more appropriate when there is no such ordering, such as with colors or names.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are building a machine learning model to predict a person's income based on their level of education,\n",
    "you might use ordinal encoding to encode the education level variable, as there is a natural ordering to the categories. \n",
    "On the other hand, if you are building a model to predict a person's favorite color based on other factors, you might use\n",
    "label encoding for the color variable, as there is no inherent ordering to the colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable,\n",
    "by assigning ordinal values to each category. The goal of this encoding is to capture the relationship between the\n",
    "categorical variable and the target variable. In other words, categories that have a similar effect on the target variable\n",
    "will have similar ordinal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of Target Guided Ordinal Encoding involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Group the categories of the categorical variable by their corresponding target variable value.\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean or median of the target variable for each group.\n",
    "3. Assign an ordinal value to each category based on its corresponding mean or median value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works. Let's say we have a dataset that contains\n",
    "information about customers, including their age, income, and whether or not they purchased a product. We want to predict\n",
    "whether a new customer will purchase the product based on their age and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode the age variable. First, we group the age variable by their\n",
    "corresponding target variable value (i.e., whether or not they purchased the product). Then, we calculate the mean\n",
    "or median income for each age group. Finally, we assign an ordinal value to each age group based on its corresponding\n",
    "mean or median income value.\n",
    "The result is a new variable that captures the relationship between age and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful in a machine learning project when the categorical variable has a strong \n",
    "relationship with the target variable, and when we want to capture this relationship in a numerical form. For example, \n",
    "if we are building a model to predict customer churn, we may use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode the categorical\n",
    "variable \"loyalty level\", which measures how loyal a customer is to the company. By encoding this variable based on the \n",
    "customer's churn rate, we can capture the relationship between loyalty level and churn rate and use it to improve the \n",
    "accuracy of our model.\n",

    "\n",
    "3.Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. More specifically, \n",
    "covariance measures how two variables vary together. If two variables have a positive covariance, it means that they tend \n",
    "to increase or decrease together. If two variables have a negative covariance, it means that they tend to have an opposite \n",
    "relationship - as one variable increases, the other decreases. If the covariance between two variables is zero, \n",
    "it means that there is no relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it can help us understand the nature and strength of the\n",
    "relationship between two variables. This information is useful in a variety of settings, such as in finance where it is\n",
    "used to understand the relationship between different stocks in a portfolio, or in social science research where it is \n",
    "used to understand the relationship between different variables that impact human behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]\n",
    "\n",
    "where X and Y are two random variables, and E[] represents the expected value (i.e., the average value) of the variable\n",
    "inside the brackets. In other words, covariance is the expected value of the product of the deviations of X and Y from\n",
    "their respective means.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that covariance can be positive, negative, or zero, and its magnitude is dependent on the scale of\n",
    "the variables being analyzed. This can make it difficult to compare covariances between different variable pairs.\n",
    "Therefore, it is common to normalize covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of the two\n",
    "variables.\n",
    "This normalized version is called correlation, which has a range of -1 to 1 and is easier to interpret and compare between \n",
    "different variable pairs.\n",

    "6.There are different encoding methods available for categorical variables, and the choice of method depends on the\n",

    "- Gender: Binary encoding. Since there are only two categories (Male and Female), we can use binary encoding to convert\n",

    "the two categories without creating multiple columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Education Level: Ordinal encoding. Education Level has a natural order to it, with High School being the lowest level\n",
    "and PhD being the highest level. Therefore, we can use ordinal encoding to encode this variable, where each category is\n",
    "assigned a numerical value based on its position in the order. For example, we can assign 0 to High School, \n",
    "1 to Bachelor's, 2 to Master's, and 3 to PhD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Employment Status: One-hot encoding. Since there are more than two categories, we can use one-hot encoding to\n",
    "convert this variable to a numerical format. One-hot encoding creates a binary column for each category, and assigns \n",
    "a 1 to the column corresponding to the category of each data point, and 0 to all other columns. This method is suitable\n",
    "when the categories do not have a natural order to them, and there is no inherent relationship between them. \n",
    "Therefore, we can create three binary columns for Unemployed, Part-Time, and Full-Time, and assign a 1 to the\n",
    "corresponding column for each data point.\n",
